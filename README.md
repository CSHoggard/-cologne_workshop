## Workshop: Geometric Morphometrics for Archaeologists
#### Date: 12th-13th December 2019
#### Instructor: Dr. Christian Steven Hoggard
#### Location: University of Cologne (Cologne, Germany)

#### About the workshop

This workshop is designed to provide an introduction into the application and potential of geometric morphometric (GMM) methodologists for archaeologists, researchers and enthusiasts in the R Environment. The workshop first introduces participants to the mathematical underpinnings of statistical shape and form, before detailing the fundamentals of geometric morphometrics, emphasising its statistical power and converage in comparison to traditional morphometrics.

#### Provisional timetable:

Day One (Morning):  
•	Introductory lecture (What is Geometric Morphometrics?)  
•	Some basics in R (environment and generating data)  
•	Organising data for morphometrics (image processing and writing data)  
•	Geometric Transformations  

Day One (Afternoon):  
•	Procrustes Superimposition  
•	Other imposition methods (e.g. Resistant Fit)  
•	Representing shape differences (warp grids, arrows, etc.)  
•	Exploring shape variation and testing hypotheses (PCA, multivariate regression, MANOVA, LDA and cladistics)  

Day Two (Morning):  
•	Acquiring outline data in R  
•	Fourier Analysis (principles)   
•	Radius Fourier Analysis  
•	Elliptic Fourier Analysis  
•	Outline data exploration  

Day Two (Afternoon):  
•	Advanced analytical frameworks (e.g. Maximum Likelihoods and cluster techniques)  
•	Advanced outline methods (symmetry and rectilinearity extraction)  
•	Concluding remarks

#### Software

Software: All data input, manipulation and analyses will be **performed in the R Environment through geomorph (BETA version) and Momocs**. **_Please ensure R/RStudio and all files are downloaded onto your computer/laptop before or at the beginning of the workshop_**. Other digitisation methods including tpsDig2 (https://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/soft-dataacq.html) and GUImorph (https://github.com/GUImorph/GUImorph) will also be showcased.
